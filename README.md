### Data Through 2016
The marathon data was found through links this article https://towardsdatascience.com/analysing-elite-running-performance-with-historical-data-b9c6bdd9c5d8 in the reference section (marked [1] and [3]). These datasets were scraped sites that record running results and wrangled by Kaggle users. The first dataset was scraped from sports-reference.com and contains the height and weight of athletes, as well as the years they competed in the Olympic games. The second was scraped from alltime-athletics.com and contains the top 1000 times recorded for various Olympic distances, including the athletes' names and country of origin. This should not be confused with the top 1000 times of Olympic running events, which is a mistake that results in bad prediction, as will be discussed later. The final dataset we used can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/country-regional-and-world-gdp. It contains the gross domestic product (GDP) of most countries, as well as the associated country code. It should be noted that we only used the GDP from 2016.
